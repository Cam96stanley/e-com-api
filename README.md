## üìå About the Project

**E-Com-API** is a RESTful API built during my time at [Coding Temple](https://www.codingtemple.com/). It serves as the backend for a basic e-commerce system, using Flask and SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with a MySQL database.

The project includes:

- Three core models: `User`, `Product`, and `Order`
- An association table for the many-to-many relationship between Orders and Products
- Marshmallow schemas for serialization and validation
- Multiple API endpoints for full CRUD functionality

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies Used

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing

## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
e-com-api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py # Main Flask application with models and api calls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore # Files to exclude from version control
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the E-Com API locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cam96stanley/e-com-api.git
cd e-com-api
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

For Linux/MacOS

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your Database

Make sure you have a MySQL server running and create a database named **_ecommerce_api_**
Update your database URI in **_app.py_**:

```bash
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/ecommerce_api'
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The API should now be running at ***http://127.0.0.1:5000/***.

## üß™ Testing

Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to test endpoints. You can test all routes using JSON requests and instpect reponses directly.

## üõ† Future Enhancements

The following features and improvements are planned for future versions of the E-Com-API:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:

   - Implement user authentication using JWT to secure API endpoints and allow users to register, login, and access protected resources.

2. **Order History**:

   - Add an endpoint to view a user's order history, showing all previous orders and associated products.

3. **Product Categories**:

   - Implement product categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) to better organize the products and allow filtering by category.

4. **Shopping Cart**:

   - Introduce a shopping cart feature where users can add products to their cart before completing the order.

5. **Improved Error Handling**:

   - Implement more detailed error messages and status codes to improve the user experience when interacting with the API.

6. **Admin Dashboard**:

   - Develop an admin dashboard for managing users, products, and orders from a web interface.

7. **Product Reviews**:
   - Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for products, enhancing user engagement.

These enhancements will be incorporated in future releases to improve functionality and usability.
